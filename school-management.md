# project rquirements 
## home page
Create a dynamic school website homepage with sections like Header, Image Carousel, About, Courses, Events, Achievements, Gallery, Testimonials, CTA, and Footer. All content must be managed through an Admin Panel, with data stored in a MySQL database. The Admin Panel should allow adding, editing, and deleting homepage content such as carousel images, events, courses, gallery photos, and contact info. The homepage should load data dynamically via PHP APIs and AJAX.
## login page 
Create a Login Page for a school management system with fields for Username/Email and Password, including validation, 'Remember Me', and 'Forgot Password' options. Implement role-based redirection so Admin, Teacher, Cashier, Student, and Parent each land on their respective dashboards after login. Use MySQL with PHP for backend authentication, hashed passwords for security, and AJAX with API for smooth login without page reloads. The design should be responsive and styled using Tailwind + Bootstrap, with dynamic error and success messages.
## header
Design a modern admin panel header for a school management system. The header must include the school logo, navigation menu for Dashboard, Students, Teachers, Classes, Attendance, Exams, Fees, Events, Gallery, and Settings. On the right side, show an Admin profile dropdown with Profile, Change Password, and Logout options. Each module page should have its own header with the module title, breadcrumb navigation, a search bar, and quick action buttons (like Add, Edit, Export). The design should be responsive, using Tailwind + Bootstrap styles, with dynamic data managed by MySQL and editable from the Admin Panel."
## menu 
 Create a responsive admin panel menu for a school management system. The menu should be a collapsible sidebar with icons and text. It must include links for Dashboard, Students, Teachers, Classes & Subjects, Attendance, Exams & Results, Fees, Events, Gallery, Reports, and Settings. Each item should have submenus where required. The active page should be highlighted. Menu data (titles, icons, links, visibility) should be stored in a MySQL database and controlled by the Admin Panel with role-based permissions. On mobile view, the menu should collapse into a drawer. At the bottom, include an Admin user profile section with Profile, Change Password, and Logout options.
## module permissions :- 
Create a role-based permission system for a school management system with four roles: Admin, Teacher, Cashier, and Student. Admin has full access to all modules including user management, students, teachers, classes, attendance, exams, fees, events, gallery, reports, and settings. Teachers can manage attendance, marks, and classes only for their assigned subjects. Cashiers can only manage fees, payments, receipts, and financial reports. Students have read-only access to their own attendance, results, fees, profile, and announcements. All permissions must be stored in a MySQL database, with the ability to edit roles and permissions from the Admin Panel.
## admin pages :-
Create an Admin Panel for a school management system with the following pages: Dashboard, Students, Teachers, Classes & Subjects, Attendance, Exams & Results, Fees, Events & Announcements, Gallery, Reports, and Settings. Each page should support CRUD operations and display data in dynamic tables with filters and search options. The Dashboard must include graphs and quick stats. The Students, Teachers, Classes, Attendance, Exams, and Fees pages must allow full data management with import/export support. The Events, Gallery, and Homepage content must sync with the public website dynamically. The Reports page should allow exporting data to PDF and Excel. The Settings page must provide user management, permissions, school info, homepage customization, and API security options. All data should be stored in MySQL and controlled via Admin Panel.
(admin module)
## Dashboard Page :-
The Dashboard serves as the central hub of the Admin Panel, providing a quick overview of the entire school’s activities. It displays key statistics such as the total number of students, teachers, and classes, along with financial summaries of collected and pending fees. Graphs and charts showcase student attendance percentages, fee collection trends, and exam performance summaries. Notifications highlight important alerts like upcoming events, pending fee payments, and exam schedules. Quick action buttons allow the admin to immediately add new students, teachers, or events without navigating to other modules.
## Students Page :-
The Students page allows full management of student records within the system. It provides a searchable and filterable table view where admins can easily locate students by class, section, or name. From here, the admin can add new students using an admission form, edit existing student details, or delete records if necessary. Each student has an individual profile page displaying personal details, guardian information, assigned class, fee status, attendance history, and academic results. The page also supports data import/export in Excel or CSV format for bulk management, along with an option to generate student ID cards.
## Teachers Page :-
The Teachers page is dedicated to managing teacher profiles and academic responsibilities. Admins can add new teachers by entering their qualifications, subject specializations, and contact details. Teachers can be assigned to classes and subjects, ensuring accurate workload distribution. Each teacher has a profile page containing their attendance, assigned classes, timetable, and performance metrics. The admin can edit or delete records as needed, and search tools make it easy to filter teachers by subject or department.
## Classes & Subjects Page:- 
The Classes & Subjects page enables the admin to organize academic structures. Admins can create new classes and sections, assign subjects to them, and link teachers to specific subjects. This ensures that each class has a complete academic framework with students and teachers properly connected. The page also allows viewing all students assigned to a particular class and optionally supports timetable management, giving a structured overview of daily schedules.
## Attendance Page:-
The Attendance page provides tools for recording and managing both student and teacher attendance. Admins can select a class or teacher and mark daily attendance using checkboxes for Present, Absent, or Late. Attendance data can also be uploaded in bulk using CSV or Excel files. The system generates detailed reports that can be viewed by class, student, or teacher over a specified time period. Graphical summaries allow quick insights into attendance trends and performance.
## Exams & Results Page:- 
The Exams & Results page allows the admin to create exams, assign subjects, and manage student marks. Exams can be categorized as mid-term, final, or custom, with dates and maximum marks defined for each subject. Teachers can enter marks for their subjects, and the system automatically calculates totals, percentages, and grades. Admins can generate class-wise or student-wise results, download printable report cards in PDF format, and publish results to the student portal for viewing.
## Fees Page:-
The Fees page manages the school’s financial transactions. Admins can define fee structures based on class, term, or special services like transport and hostel. Payments can be recorded with details such as date, amount, mode (cash, cheque, online), and receipt number. The page tracks pending fees and provides options for generating and printing receipts. Comprehensive financial reports summarize collections on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, giving the admin a clear picture of school revenue.
## Events & Announcements Page:-
The Events & Announcements page allows admins to post upcoming events like annual day, sports day, or cultural functions, as well as important notices such as admission deadlines or exam schedules. Each event includes a title, description, date, venue, and optional image. Events can be published directly to the homepage carousel or scheduled in advance. An integrated calendar view provides a timeline of all upcoming and past events for easy reference.
## Gallery Page:-
The Gallery page manages all media content related to school functions and activities. Admins can upload images and videos, organize them into categories such as Sports, Cultural, or Academics, and publish them to the public gallery. The page supports bulk uploads and allows hiding or deleting media files as needed. This feature keeps the school website visually engaging and regularly updated with fresh content.
## Reports Page:-
The Reports page centralizes all analytical data in the system. Admins can generate attendance reports, exam performance summaries, financial fee reports, and teacher workload statistics. Reports can be customized by date range, class, or department and exported in PDF or Excel format for official use. This page ensures the school can analyze trends, identify issues, and present data for audits or parent meetings.
## Settings Page:-
The Settings page controls the core configuration of the school management system. Admins can update school details such as name, logo, motto, contact information, and address. User management tools allow creating, editing, or deleting accounts for Admins, Teachers, Cashiers, and Students, with role-based permissions determining access levels. The page also includes homepage content management (carousel, about section, courses, testimonials, footer), API and security settings, and options for database backup and restore.
(teacher module)
## Dashboard Page:-
The Teacher Dashboard provides a personalized overview of classes, subjects, and daily responsibilities. It displays upcoming lessons, pending attendance tasks, and exam schedules. Notifications highlight important school announcements, upcoming meetings, and submission deadlines. Teachers can also view quick statistics about their assigned classes, such as average attendance or recent exam performance.
## Class & Subject Management Page:-
This page shows all classes and subjects assigned to the teacher. Teachers can view student lists for each class, check timetables, and manage academic tasks. It allows teachers to upload study materials, assignments, or notes for their students, making it easier to share resources directly from the portal.
## Attendance Page:-
Teachers can mark daily attendance for their assigned classes. The page provides a student list with options to mark Present, Absent, or Late. Attendance can be corrected if mistakes occur, and teachers can view summary reports for their subjects. This ensures accountability while also keeping parents informed through the student portal.
## Exams & Results Page:-
Teachers use this page to enter marks for their assigned subjects during exams. They can view student performance records, update marks when necessary, and generate subject-level performance summaries. The system automatically calculates averages and grades, which teachers can review before publishing results.
## Events & Announcements Page:-
Teachers can view all school-wide events and announcements posted by the admin. They may also receive invitations or reminders for meetings, training sessions, and extracurricular activities. Depending on permissions, teachers can request to add academic-related events, such as subject-specific competitions or exhibitions.
## Profile & Settings Page:-
The profile page allows teachers to manage their personal information, update contact details, and change their password. Teachers can also set availability for classes or office hours. Settings are limited to personal preferences, as system-wide configurations are reserved for admins.
(cashier module)
## Profile photo for admin and in list student photo 
Use directory for saving photo according to id in both student and user saved like if id of student is 1 then rename the photo to 1.jpg and when update the photo delete the old photo and saved the new photo .. use sql to save the photo according to id so in website photo shows correctly .. and use photo in admit card print and other  thinngs 
## Dashboard Page:-
The Cashier Dashboard highlights daily financial activity, showing fee payments collected, pending dues, and overall revenue summaries. Alerts display overdue payments and students with pending balances. Quick links provide access to payment entry and receipt generation for faster operations.
## Fee Management Page:-
This is the core of the cashier’s work. It allows recording student fee payments with details like payment date, amount, method (cash, cheque, online), and receipt number. The cashier can search for students by name or class to update their payment status. The system generates instant receipts that can be printed or shared with parents.
## Pending Fees Page:-
This page provides a list of students who have outstanding fees. The cashier can filter by class or due amount and send reminders or generate pending fee reports. This helps track collections and follow up with parents systematically.
## Financial Reports Page:-
Cashiers can generate reports of collected fees, pending dues, and daily, monthly, or yearly summaries. Reports can be exported in PDF or Excel formats and shared with the admin for financial planning. Unlike the admin, the cashier’s reporting is restricted only to finance-related data.
Profile & Settings Page:-The cashier’s profile page allows managing personal details and password changes. Since financial security is critical, role-based restrictions ensure cashiers cannot access academic data or alter school-wide settings.
(student module)
